          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>
            Born and raised in New York City, I've always had a love for
            writing. It was in high school where I strengthened my writing and
            creativity. As a result, I've written three of my 4 current books
            while still in highschool. I tried publishing in the past.
            Unfortunately the editing service provided was less than what I
            expected. This led me to learn how to evaluate, and edit, a
            manuscript on my own. As the author, I am my own worst critic and
            was certain to make my books as ready for publication as I possibly
            could. Now, the first book is weeks away from being released for
            publication with more to follow.

            The time has finally arrived! The time for my works of art to see
            the light of day through publication.

            I've always had a love for writing. My passion and creativity led to
            the birth of 4 books and countless story ideas. I tried publishing
            in the past, but unfortunately the editing service provided was less
            than what I expected. This led me to learn how to evaluate, and
            edit, a manuscript.
